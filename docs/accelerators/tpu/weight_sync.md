# Google TPU Weight Sync

Two checkpoint engines send the trainer's updated weights to the [vLLM rollout](./rollout.md) on TPU.
Pick one with `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.backend`:

| Backend | How the weights travel |
|---------|------------------------|
| `tpu` | Trainer rank 0 gathers the full model and puts it in the Ray object store. Every rollout worker then pulls it and cuts out its own shard. |
| `raiden` | The trainer chips send straight to the rollout chips over the network with [tpu-sync](https://github.com/google/tpu-sync) (Raiden). Each rollout chip receives only its own tensor-parallel shard. |

`raiden` is faster: the weights skip the round trip through the object store, and no rollout worker
receives the whole model.

## How a `raiden` sync works

The driver runs each sync (`update_raiden_weights`, which replaces `CheckpointEngineManager.update_weights`
for this backend):

1. It pauses generation. The initial sync at step 0 skips this.
2. Every trainer rank binds the full weights, which verl gathers on every rank, to its tpu-sync
   `WeightSynchronizer` and copies them to host memory. On the first sync it creates that synchronizer and
   registers it with the Raiden controller, which the driver starts at the same time; later syncs rebind the
   new tensors to the existing synchronizer, as long as the tensor names, shapes and dtypes do not change. The
   trainer also publishes the full shape of every tensor in the `RayWeightRegistry` actor.
3. On the first sync only, every rollout worker allocates tensor-parallel receive buffers of those shapes
   and registers them. With several rollout replicas (`rollout.tensor_model_parallel_size` smaller than the
   number of rollout chips), each replica registers under its own job name, `sampler0`, `sampler1`, ...
4. The controller moves the weights from the trainer hosts to the rollout hosts: one transfer per rollout
   replica, issued together.
5. The trainer unbinds its send buffers, returning their HBM to training, and keeps the synchronizer (its
   pinned host buffers and controller registration) for the next sync. Meanwhile, each rollout worker copies
   the weights to HBM and fuses q/k/v and gate/up into vLLM's parameters. With `verify_parity=exact` or
   `all`, on the step-0 sync it first compares every received tensor bit for bit with the parameter it is
   about to overwrite (see below).
6. Generation resumes, tagged with the new weight version.

## Requirements

- `tpu-sync-torch` installed on every trainer and rollout host, built for the installed `torch-tpu`.
  The tpu-sync torch extension is ABI-locked to the `torch-tpu` build it was compiled against. A
  mismatched pair crashes in the first transfer. The backend is tested with `torch-tpu`
  `0.1.2.dev20261006000518` and `tpu-sync-torch` `0.0.1.dev20261006025601` (image
  `us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/tpu-pytorch/raycluster/verl-tpu:v20261006-tsync1006`).
  - `WeightSynchronizer.unbind_weights()` needs `tpu-sync-torch` `0.0.1.dev20261006025601` or newer. With
    an older build (e.g. `0.0.1.dev20261001132139`) the trainer logs a warning once and falls back to
    destroying and re-creating its synchronizer every sync, which adds a few seconds per sync for an 8B
    model.
- Network connectivity between the hosts:
  - from all trainer and rollout hosts to the Raiden controller, which runs in the driver process;
  - from the trainer hosts to the rollout hosts. Every rollout worker listens on a port the OS assigns, which
    it registers with the controller.

## Configuration

```bash
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.backend=raiden
# Optional, see the table below:
+actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.engine_kwargs.raiden.parallelism=8
+actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.engine_kwargs.raiden.verify_parity=all
+actor_rollout_ref.rollout.checkpoint_engine.engine_kwargs.raiden.release_buffers_after_sync=True
```

| Option (`engine_kwargs.raiden.*`) | Default | Description |
|-----------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `parallelism` | `8` | Parallel transfer streams per worker. |
| `verify_parity` | `off` | Checks for bring-up, see [Verify](#verify). `norm` (or `True`): after every sync from step 1, compare per-tensor weight norms between trainer and rollout and log the result; adds a pass over all weights on both sides. `exact`: on the step-0 sync of a fresh run, every rollout worker compares each received tensor bit for bit with the vLLM parameter it overwrites, which still holds the checkpoint; catches a wrong shard slice, tiling or fusion that keeps the norms unchanged. `all`: both. |
| `release_buffers_after_sync` | `True` | Unbind the send buffers (a bf16 copy of the full model on every trainer chip) after every transfer, so training gets that HBM back between syncs. Set to `False` to keep them resident. The environment variable `VERL_RAIDEN_RELEASE_BUFFERS` overrides the option on the trainer workers. |

## Metrics

Each sync returns its phase timings. Trainers that record weight-sync metrics, such as the separate-async
trainer, log them with the step metrics:

| Metric | Phase |
|--------|-------|
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/quiesce` | Pausing generation |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/trainer_init` | Trainer ranks gathering their weights, creating and registering a synchronizer, and copying the weights to host memory |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/sampler_init` | Rollout workers allocating and registering their receive buffers |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/barrier` | Waiting until every worker has registered |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/p2p_transfer` | The transfer |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/sampler_h2d` | Rollout workers copying the weights to HBM and into vLLM's parameters |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/sampler_h2d_pure` | The host-to-device copy alone, on the slowest rollout worker |
| `timing_s/tpu-sync/total_sync` | The whole sync after pausing generation |

`sampler_h2d_pure` and the `verify_parity` check depend on the rollout workers' return values, which
verl's vLLM server does not yet pass back from `collective_rpc`. Until it does, the sync still works, but
`sampler_h2d_pure` is not reported and the parity check logs a warning instead of a result.

## Verify

On any host, without tpu-sync, vLLM or a TPU:

```bash
pytest tests/accelerators/tpu/test_raiden_checkpoint_engine.py -v
```

On TPU, set `VERL_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO` and `SAGEMAKER_CONTAINER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` in the job's `env_vars`, as
in the [vLLM Rollout](./rollout.md) example. Every sync then logs its phase times. For example, from a
Qwen3-0.6B run with one v6e-8 slice for training and one for rollout:

```text
[RAIDEN TELEMETRY | Orchestrator] Step 1 Completed in 1.9739s:
  * Sampler Quiesce/Pause  : 0.0338s
  * Trainer Raiden Init    : 1.0341s
  * Sampler Raiden Init    : 0.0063s
  * Raiden Barrier Check   : 0.0002s
  * RaidenController P2P   : 0.1317s
  * Sampler H2D DMA        : 0.0318s
  * Total End-to-End Sync  : 1.9739s
```

The first sync (step 0) is slower, because the rollout workers allocate and register their receive
buffers then. With `verify_parity=norm` (or `True`), every sync after the first also logs

```text
[RAIDEN PARITY VERIFIED | Step 1] 100% DISTRIBUTED NORM PARITY CONFIRMED!
```

once per rollout replica: with several replicas, `[RAIDEN PARITY] step 1: checking rollout replica K`
precedes each `PARITY VERIFIED | Step 1 replica K` line. With `verify_parity=exact` (or `all`), the step-0
sync logs

```text
[RAIDEN PARITY EXACT | Step 0] <ranks> sampler ranks, [<tensors>] tensors checked per rank, 0 mismatched, 0 unresolved: every received tensor matches the checkpoint bit for bit
```

or, on a mismatch, an error listing the differing tensors per rank. The exact check needs the trainer's
step-0 weights to equal the checkpoint vLLM loaded, so it is skipped when resuming from a checkpoint
(`global_steps > 0` on the first sync).

These lines come from the driver process. There, vLLM's serving code imports
`model_hosting_container_standards`, which sets Python's root logger to `SAGEMAKER_CONTAINER_LOG_LEVEL`
(default `ERROR`). Without the variable, the driver drops the plugin's `INFO` and `WARNING` messages.
Errors, such as a parity mismatch, are always logged.
