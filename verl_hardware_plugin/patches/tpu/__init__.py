"""TPU monkeypatches for verl-core call sites that do not yet consult the platform.

``PlatformTPU`` already implements every hook a TPU run needs
(``auto_assign_accelerator_type``, ``configure_placement_group_bundle``,
``ray_local_rank_override`` ...), but verl main only calls a subset of them
(``supports_colocated_worker_groups``, ``ray_resource_name``,
``get_worker_env_vars``; see verl-project/verl#7849). Each module in this
package bridges one remaining call site by routing it through the existing
hook, so that once verl-core calls the hook itself the corresponding patch
can simply be deleted. The patch modules are:

- ``ray_resource_pool_patch``: slice affinity + rollout bundles without a
  ``TPU`` reservation (``RayResourcePool``).
- ``worker_local_rank_patch``: ``LOCAL_RANK`` from ``TPU_VISIBLE_CHIPS`` and
  no eager ``set_device`` in ``CheckpointEngineWorker`` (``Worker``).

Trainer-side patches (lazy: their targets are heavy verl modules that are only
imported in trainer workers, so they are installed by the ``Worker`` patch once
the worker class has been imported, never imported just to be patched):

- ``separation_cpu_copy_patch``: TorchTitan CPU save/restore handlers for the
  ``separate_async`` actor worker (``DetachActorWorker``).
- ``ppo_loss_patch``: ``ppo_loss`` that consumes the engine's differentiable
  ``_tpu_padded_values`` (``verl.workers.utils.losses`` /
  ``verl.workers.engine_workers``).

Every patch is idempotent and only installs itself when its target module is
fully imported, because ``PlatformTPU()`` may be constructed from a
module-level ``get_device_name()`` call while heavier verl modules are still
importing. ``apply_all(import_targets=True)`` -- used by the Ray
``worker_process_setup_hook`` ``patch_ray_worker``, which runs in a fresh
worker process before any verl import -- imports the targets explicitly and is
the authoritative installation point; the other call sites are best-effort
re-tries.
